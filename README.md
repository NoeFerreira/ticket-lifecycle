<h3 align="center">Intake</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Karen (User) creates a ticket:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Ticket assignment</h3>
<br />
<p>
  John Doe (Support Agent) logs in.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Communication</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent John sees this is Sev-A emergency ticket and reassigns the ticket to a System Administrator.
</p>
<p>
  He makes sure to leave a proper message:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Working the issue</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Jane Doe (System Administrator) logs in:
</p>
<p>
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e023cb70-3155-4768-831f-6b296d0590f1" height="75%" width="100%" alt="Sys admin agent login"/>
</p>
<p>
  Agent Jane works the issue and communicates back to Agent John.
</p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<h3 align="center">Resolution</h3>
<br />
<p>
  Agent John sees in his portal that System Administrator agent Jane has left him a message and that the ticket is now closed:>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<br />
<br />
<p>
  This was a basic example of how a ticket is created by a user, assigned to an agent, and used to facilitate communication between agents, ultimately leading to a resolution.
</p>
<p>
  Additional scenarios may arise during the assessment of a ticket. For instance, a ticket may be reassigned to a different department, escalated in severity, or transferred to a more qualified agent or specialized team, depending on the nature of the issue and its potential impact on business operations.
</p>
<p>
  Help desk agents may handle anywhere from 10 to 100 tickets per day, depending on the size and nature of the organization. I hope this tutorial provided a clearer understanding and general overview of a ticket's life cycle.
